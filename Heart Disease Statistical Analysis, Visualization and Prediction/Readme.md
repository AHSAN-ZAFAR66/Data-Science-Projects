# Heart Disease Statistical Analysis and Prediction Through Machine Learning
This project involves an in-depth analysis of heart disease-related datasets sourced from Kaggle and IEEE. The datasets were preprocessed, merged, and analyzed comprehensively through various statistical techniques, visualization, and machine learning models.

# Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Merged and preprocessed datasets from Kaggle and IEEE to create a consolidated dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate Analysis: Conducted visualizations to explore individual variables' distributions and characteristics.
Bivariate Analysis: Utilized statistical methods and visualizations to study relationships between variables.
Statistical Analysis: Employed t-tests for numerical variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables to derive insights.
Machine Learning Models: Utilized machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling based on the analyzed dataset.

# Key Highlights
Data Merging and Preprocessing: Combined datasets from different sources for comprehensive analysis.
Exploratory Analysis: In-depth visualization and statistical analysis to understand variable relationships and distributions.
Statistical Testing: Employed t-tests and chi-square tests to derive significant insights.
Machine Learning Prediction: Utilized machine learning models to predict heart disease based on the analyzed data.
