# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and NLP
This project aims to analyze sentiments from Twitter text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Analyzing sentiments from non-numeric data, particularly text-based data like tweets, enables the extraction of valuable insights and sentiments for various purposes.

# Project Overview
Objective: Leveraging NLP concepts to gauge sentiments expressed in tweets, thereby understanding public opinion and sentiments related to specific topics.
Dataset Description: Textual data from Twitter containing messages and their corresponding sentiment categories (Neutral, Negative, Positive).
Tasks Included:
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing text data by converting to lower case, removing symbols, punctuation, and stopwords.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features such as the length of sentences (word count).
Modeling: Utilizing LSTM and NLP techniques to build a sentiment analysis model.
Tools Used:
Python Libraries: Pandas for data operations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization, NLTK for text analysis, tensorflow & keras for model building and evaluation.

# Key Highlights
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Transformation and cleansing of raw tweet data for meaningful analysis.
Feature Engineering: Generating new features to enrich the dataset for modeling.
NLP Techniques: Utilizing NLP concepts to extract sentiments and insights from textual data.
LSTM Model Building: Employing LSTM neural networks for sentiment classification.
