# Customer Complaint Resolution Analysis & Classification
This project focuses on understanding and analyzing customer sentiments and categorizations concerning product reviews, aiming to enhance customer service and sales growth. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas for data operations, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Sklearn for model building, this analysis delves into predicting customer categories based on complaints received.

# Objective
The primary objective is to classify customer categories (dispute or no dispute) using various algorithms to predict dispute status based on provided data. This project aims to offer insights into customer sentiment and to predict the likelihood of disputes, assisting in proactive customer service resolution strategies.

# Key Highlights
Data Exploration: Utilized Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for comprehensive exploratory data analysis.
Model Building: Employed Sklearn to develop and evaluate predictive models for customer category classification.
Outcome Prediction: The project focuses on predicting whether a customer dispute exists based on the provided data.
