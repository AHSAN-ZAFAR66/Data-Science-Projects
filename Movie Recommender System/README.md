# Movie Recommender System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project, a culmination of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts . This project revolves around creating recommendation models for movies using open-source data from MovieLens, facilitating the team's exploration of diverse recommendation techniques.

# Project Overview
With the advent of Over The Top (OTT) streaming platforms like Netflix, PrimeVideo, and others, accessing video content has become easier. However, the abundance of choices often leads to decision paralysis when selecting movies. 
Popularity-Based Recommender: Recommends popular movies within a specified genre based on user-defined rating thresholds.
Content-Based Recommender: Suggests movies similar to a chosen genre.
Collaborative Filtering Recommender: Leverages user preferences to offer personalized movie recommendations.

# Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Preparing different data for three different types of recommender systems.
Recommender Systems: Three recommender systems are made which are Content Based, Popularity Based and User Collborative Filtering based recommender system.
